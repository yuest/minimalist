#Blogging Like A Minimalist Hacker

[Minimalist.js](http://github.com/yuest/minimalist/) is the blog engine behind [yue.st](http://yue.st) to let me blog like a minimalist.  I write the core feature of it in a minimal time so I can use it ASAP and I believe it will evolve slowly as I feel some feature **MUST** be implemented :)

##Usage

Use a 404.html containing a `script` tag to use minimalist.js and a `article#from-markdown` or `div#article-from-markdown` tag to hold the article generated by your markdown file.  Below is a simplest example.

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Yuest's Homepage</title>
        <script src="https://raw.github.com/yuest/minimalist/0.1.0/minimalist.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <article id="from-markdown"></article>
    </body>

Then write your artile in markdown and save it with `.md` extension in your *username.github.com* repository.  If your save it in */blog/2012-02-08.md* in your repo, you cloud visit it at *http://username.github.com/blog/2012-02-08.html* - just replace `.md` to `.html`.

In your markdown source files, your should use **relative path** to link between two articles. For example `[yestoday](./2012-02-07.md)` in */blog/2012-02-08.md* will lead you to */blog/2012-02-07.md*.  you cloud also use absolute path like `[yestoday](/blog/2012-02-07.md)`, but the link will broke when you visit your markdown source file on github.com, use relative path will work on both.

Also, *readme.md* will be the default file when you visit a directory as the same reason.


That's all.  Enjoy your writing.
